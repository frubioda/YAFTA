12 APR 05 --- Added .maxb field to structure in create_features.pro

28 Apr 05 --- Changed .SRC, .TRM, .LABEL fields to longword integer.
	      (Integer overflow occurred w/more than ~32,000 features.)

09 May 05 --- Wrote dual-label logic, for tracking both contiguous and 
	      convex features in parallel.  Included new string-
	      valued field ALT_LABEL, and routines ALT_MASK.PRO 
	      (which uses IDL's LABEL_REGION.PRO) and MATCH_MASKS.PRO.
	      Use main-level code YAFTA_DUALMASK.PRO for such tracking.

16 May 05 --- Included add'l fields in each structure FEATURE, 
	      for calculating errors in position and moments.
	      The square root of the product of the new fields, 
	      XERR, YERR, X2ERR, Y2ERR, and XYERR, and the average 
	      noise per pixel, gives the error in each of these 
	      quantities.

17 May 05 --- Fixed three MAX_COL bugs in PLOT_EDGES.PRO
	  --- Modified code for offset DX in PLOT_EDGES.PRO

19 May 05 --- Erroroneous comment in YAFTA_test.pro listed 1433 km 
	      as MDI Hi-Res pixel size; this is actually MDI 
	      Full-Disk pixel size.
	      In CREATE_FEATURES.PRO, included a factor of 2 
	      in .XY and .XYERR fields.

31 May 05 --- Added set_plot,'ps' before square_plot,'ps' in 
	      YAFTA_test.pro
	  --- Added "if not(keyword_set(ps)) then" prior to 
	      "window,0" call in YAFTA_test.pro
	  --- Changed not(keyword_set(ct)) to (n_elements(ct) eq 0)
	      in PLOT_EDGES.PRO and PLOT_LABELS.PRO.

28 Jun 05 --- R. Maclean (U. of St. Andrews) encountered a bug on a DEC 
	      station, wherein IDL refused to concatenate the anonymous 
	      structures "feature".  A work around was found, in which 
	      named structures are used instead of anonymous structures. 
	      by replacing 
	feature = {label:label_j, ...
	      with
	feature = {feature,label:label_j, ...

08 Jul 05 --- Added edgepix keyword to PLOT_EDGES.PRO, to return 1D 
	      addresses of pixels on features' edges.
